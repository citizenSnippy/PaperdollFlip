# PaperdollFlip

PaperdollFlip is a very small and simple mod which just flips the display of the 'Mech paperdoll in the UI, making it so that screen left is 'Mech left, and screen right is 'Mech right.

This is closer to how 'Mechs were depicted in CBT, and some people find it more intuitive. YMMV!
